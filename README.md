# 🎲 Tenzies Game

A simple and fun dice game built with **React** — implemented as part of the **"Learn React"** course on [Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/) by **Bob Ziroll**.

## 📘 About the Project

This project is a React-based version of the classic **Tenzies** game.  
The goal of the game is to roll the dice until all of them show the same number.  
Players can **hold** specific dice to keep their values between rolls.

This implementation follows along with the lessons from the Scrimba course **“Learn React”** by Bob Ziroll.  
While the project is not an original creation, it reflects my understanding and practice of key React concepts learned in the course.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through building this project, I practiced and reinforced the following React concepts:

- Components and props
- State management with `useState`
- Rendering lists and conditional styling
- Handling user events
- Using `useEffect` for game logic

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Click **Roll** to roll all dice.  
2. Click any die to **hold** its current value.  
3. Keep rolling until all dice show the same number — then you win! 🎉
